*1: Maybe needs a better logic, I need to set to 0 for the case 'cmd;',
	usually the builtin still has the old value and the 'cmd' get executed twice

*2: This loop is here to avoid seg fault in empty echo, looping while args exist

*3: cd .. ; unset OLDPWD ; cd $OLDPWD ; pwd		(difference between "" and NULL)
	export what ; env | grep "what"				(lags here!! / grep doesn't find what because it has no value)		SOLVED
	unset PATH + ls /bin/ls																							SOLVED
	OLDPWD at beginning of program				(its usually set from parent shell)									SOLVED
	what is printed in env and in export																			SOLVED	
	difference export PATH AND export PATH= AND unset PATH															SOLVED
	./file ./dir handling																							SOLVED
	unset e$									(has to do with parser)

	mkdir testdir
	cd testdir
	rm -rf ../testdir ; echo $OLDPWD; echo $PWD; cd . ; echo $PWD; cd .; echo $PWD									SOLVED

	export A='    aa   ' B='    bb   ' C='    ccc   '
	echo "$A$B$C"										//	aa       bb       ccc   
	echo $A$B$C											//	aa bb ccc
