*1: Maybe needs a better logic, I need to set to 0 for the case 'cmd;',
	usually the builtin still has the old value and the 'cmd' get executed twice

*2: This loop is here to avoid seg fault in empty echo, looping while args exist

*3: cd .. ; unset OLDPWD ; cd $OLDPWD ; pwd		(difference between "" and NULL)
	export what ; env | grep "what"				(lags here!! / grep doesn't find what because it has no value)
	unset e$									(has to do with parser)

*4: what is printed in env and in export
